# strange-machine

Build a weird little machine for your oddly specific task.

## About

Strange Machine lets you build and program a machine for a specific task in an environment. Examples:

- Moving pieces around in your favorite analog board game.
- Painting patterns onto your favorite specifically sized cup.
- Being portable and engraving things onto phone cases.

First, define some real-world constraints in the browser tool.
Then, talk about what tool you would use.
Next, connect the dots to build a machine and test it in the browser.
Finally, export files and code to build and control the physical machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `node server`.
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your favorite browser.
