# strange-machine

Build a weird little machine for your oddly specific task.

## About

Strange Machine is an interface that lets you create or remix high-level descriptions of digital fabrication machines.
You can load a machine or create one from scratch in the web-based simulator.
Machines are represented as assemblies of connected _blocks_, where each block represents the bounding box of some part of the machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `node server`.
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your favorite browser.

## Old "About" Section
Strange Machine lets you build and program a machine for a specific task in an environment. Examples:

- Moving pieces around in your favorite analog board game.
- Painting patterns onto your favorite specifically sized cup.
- Being portable and engraving things onto phone cases.

First, **use the tool to 3D scan your real-world environment** and define some real-world constraints in the browser tool.
Then, talk about what tool you would use.
Next, connect the dots to build a machine and test it in the browser.
Finally, export files and code to build and control the physical machine.
